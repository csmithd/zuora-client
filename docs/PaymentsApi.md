### Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **zuora_entity_ids** | **str**| An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  | [optional] 
 **page_size** | **int**| Number of rows returned per page.  | [optional] [default to 20]
 **account_id** | **str**| This parameter filters the response based on the &#x60;accountId&#x60; field.  | [optional] 
 **amount** | **float**| This parameter filters the response based on the &#x60;amount&#x60; field.  | [optional] 
 **applied_amount** | **float**| This parameter filters the response based on the &#x60;appliedAmount&#x60; field.  | [optional]

 **sort** | **str**| This parameter restricts the order of the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to sort on.  A sortable field uses the following form:   *operator* *field_name*  You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. For example:  *operator* *field_name*, *operator* *field_name*    *operator* is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field.    - The &#x60;-&#x60; operator indicates an ascending order.   - The &#x60;+&#x60; operator indicates a descending order.  By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by payment number.  *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field. The supported sortable fields of this operation are as below:    - number   - accountId   - amount   - appliedAmount   - unappliedAmount   - refundAmount   - creditBalanceAmount   - effectiveDate   - createdDate   - createdById   - updatedDate   - updatedById    Examples:  - /v1/payments?sort&#x3D;+number  - /v1/payments?status&#x3D;Processed&amp;sort&#x3D;-number,+amount  | [optional]
