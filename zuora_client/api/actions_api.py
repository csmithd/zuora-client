         This call performs many actions.  Use the subscribe call to bundle information required to create at least one new subscription.  **Note:** This feature is unavailable if you have the Orders feature enabled. See [Orders Migration Guidance](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AB_Orders_Migration_Guidance) for more information.  The call takes in an array of SubscribeRequests. Because it takes an array, you can submit a batch of subscription requests at once. You can create up to 50 different subscriptions in a single subscribe call.  This is a combined call that you can use to perform all of the following tasks in a single call:  * Create accounts * Create contacts * Create payment methods, including external payment options * Create an invoice for the subscription * Apply the first payment to a subscription  ## Object Limits  50 objects are supported in a single call.    ## Effective Date If the effective date is in the future, the invoices will not be generated, and there will be no invoice number.  ## Subscription Name, Number, and ID  ### Subscription Name and Number  The subscription name is a unique identifier for the subscription. If you do not specify a value for the name, Zuora will create one automatically. The automatically generated value is known as the subscription number, such as `A-S00000080`. You cannot change the subscription name or number after creating the subscription.   * **Subscription name**: The name that you set for the subscription. * **Subscription number**: The value generated by Zuora automatically if you do not specify a subscription name.   Both the subscription name and number must be unique. If they are not, an error will occur.  ### Subscription ID  The subscription ID is a 32-digit ID in the format 4028xxxx. This is also the unique identifier for a subscription. This value is automatically generated by the system and cannot be edited or updated, but it can be queried. One subscription can have only one subscription name or number, but it can have multiple IDs: Each version of a subscription has a different ID.  The Subscription object contains the fields `OriginalId` and `PreviousSubscriptionId`. `OriginalId` is the ID for the first version of a subscription. `PreviousSubscriptionId` is the ID of the version created immediately prior to the current version.  ## Subscription Preview  You can preview invoices that would be generated by the subscribe call.   ## Invoice Subscriptions Separately If you have enabled the invoice subscriptions separately feature, a subscribe call will generate an invoice for each subscription for every subscription where the field `IsInvoiceSeparate` is set to `true`.  If the invoice subscriptions separately feature is disabled, a subscribe call will generate a single invoice for all subscriptions.  See [Invoicing Subscriptions Separately](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Subscriptions/B_Creating_Subscriptions/Invoicing_Subscriptions_Separately) for more information.  ## Subscriptions and Draft Invoices  If a draft invoice that includes charges exists in a customer account, using the subscribe call to create a new subscription and generate an invoice will cause the new subscription to be added to the existing draft invoice. Zuora will then post the invoice.   ## When to Use Subscribe and Create Calls  You can use either the subscribe call or the create call to create the objects associated with a subscription (accounts, contacts, and so on). There are differences between these calls, however, and some situations are better for one or the other.  ### Use the Subscribe Call  The subscribe call bundles up all the information you need for a subscription. Use the subscribe call to create new subscriptions when you have all the information you need.  Subscribe calls cannot update BillTo, SoldTo, and Account objects. Payment information objects cannot be updated if there is an existing account ID in the call. These objects are not supported in a subscribe call.  ### Use the Create Call  The create call is more useful when you want to develop in stages. For example, if you want to first create an account, then a contact, and so on. If you do not have all information available, use the create call. To create a subscription, you must activate the account from Draft status to Active by calling the subscribe call.   # noqa: E501

You can specify different types of objects in different update calls, but each specific update call must apply to only one type of object.  You can update an array of one or more zObjects. It returns an array of SaveResults, indicating the success or failure of updating each object. The following information applies to this call:  * You cannot pass in null zObjects. * You can pass in a maximum of 50 zObjects at a time. * All objects must be of the same type. * For each field in each object, you must determine that object's ID. Then populate the fields that you want update with the new information. * Zuora ignores unrecognized fields in update calls. For example, if an optional field is spelled incorrectly or a field that does not exist is specified, Zuora ignores the field and continues to process the call. No error message is returned for unrecognized fields.  ## Object Limits  50 objects are supported in a single call.   # noqa: E501
